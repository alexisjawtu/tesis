\chapter{Vectorial Finite Elements}\label{aux_label43}
$H(\bcurl)$--conforming elements were
defined to determine a natural interpolation operator for fields with continuous tangential components.
Similarly, the other elements considered are $H(\Div)$--conforming, and we use them 
to interpolate fields with continuous normal components. These two are the cases of the
solutions of Stokes' equations, the solutions of time harmonic Maxwell's equations, and the
solution of the mixed formulation of the Poisson problem.

We will adopt the convention that objects like functions, variables, normals 
in the reference
prism $\hat{E}$ will have a hat as in $\hat{\bu}, \hat{\bx}, \hat{\bn},\ldots$
and then also the hat will denote a pullback transformation corresponding
to a mapping from $\hat{E}$ onto  a physical element $E$.

As we are going to deal with vectorial Finite Elements and
vectorial Virtual Elements, we are going to need to use the following notational convention.
\begin{notation} If\hspace{5pt}$V$ denotes a functional space of vectorial
fields in $\mathbb{R}^n$, whether finite dimensional
or not, $(V)_i$ denotes the space of scalar functions in the $i-$th
coordinate projection
of $V$, for $1\leqslant i\leqslant n$.
\end{notation}
For tensor product polynomial spaces involved in the construction
of $H(\bcurl)$ or $H(\Div)$ elements we will need the following notation.
\begin{notation}
  \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
    P_{k,l} 		&=& P_{k}(\hat x_1,\hat x_2) 	 \otimes P_{l}(\hat x_3)\mbox{,} \\
    Q_{k,l,m} 	&=& P_k(\hat{x}_1) \otimes P_l(\hat{x}_2)\otimes P_m(\hat{x}_3).
  \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
\end{notation}
