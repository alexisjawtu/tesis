\chapter{Local Interpolation}
We prove anisotropic local interpolation error estimates for two different operators
and use this result to estimate the global approximation error.

Edge elements are one example of $\textrm{H}(\textbf{curl})-$conforming elements, and they were
defined to determine a natural interpolation operator for fields with continuous tangential components.
Similarly, the other elements considered are $\textrm{H}(\text{div})-$conforming, and we will use them 
to interpolate fields with continuous tangential components. These are the cases of the
solutions of Stokes' equations, the solutions of time harmonic Maxwell's equations, and the vectorial
variable of the following problem, which will be our application.
